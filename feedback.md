## **Code review**
- infrastructure description could be more concise and easy to read in readme but readme is good
- good improvement plan
- main.py a bit too long, campaingsElements as well
- good typing and docstring in general but not very consistant
- code infrastructure is not very clear, what are doing del_gophish.py and compaign_script.py in the main folder? No docstring for them.
- This is a good project but it's not easy for someone else to dive into it and to understand the structure of it. I think 1 more day to polish it and add some visuals would improve this aspect. OOP could be improved as well to make it more modular. 



## **Presentation review**
- good quality presentation but some slides could be improved (improvements is a bit crowded)
- missing some visuals for the workflow (api, db, gophish,...)
- no prompt example in the slides but you did show it
- clear explanations
